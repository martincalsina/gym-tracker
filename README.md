The app is built entirely using React Native with Expo and some community packages. Thus, it's enough to clone locally this repository and have [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/download) to install the dependencies.

#### 1. Install dependencies
   In the repo's directory run:
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

#### 2. Start the app
   Just run:
   ```bash
   npm start
   ```
   and open it on your device using [Expo Go](https://expo.dev/go) or an Android Simulator.
