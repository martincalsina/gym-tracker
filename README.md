## Get Started

### Downloading the an up to date APK

The app is built using [EAS](https://docs.expo.dev/build/introduction/), so you can send [this URL](https://expo.dev/accounts/martincalsina/projects/gym-tracker/builds/8834260d-33b0-420a-b30c-997c419e5e8f) to your device to download the APK there or by scanning the following QR:

### Running the project as a dev

The app is built entirely using React Native with Expo and some community packages. Thus, it's enough to clone locally this repository and have [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/download) to install the dependencies.

#### 1. Install dependencies
   In the repo's directory run:
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

#### 2. Start the app
   Just run:
   ```bash
   npm start
   ```
   and open it on your device using [Expo Go](https://expo.dev/go) or an Android Simulator.
